Some-bodies are listening, too
Not just us

Something has been changing

An old persimmon tree nearby
Tiny yellow flowers 
used to fall like a rain shower
sounding just like real rain
Stray cats come to drink water beneath the tree
She had placed several white bowls of water
When a flower fell into the empty bowl, 
it rang softly. 

How's the weather there? 

Are you there? 

Some-bodies are listening, too
Not just us

A box with two silicon ears  
seated on the stone wall 
for over six years
letting the sound flow somewhere 
Waiting 
forgetting that I’m waiting
still, I remain  

Every dawn, I witness the birds’ first call 
It's coming closer 
It’s about to pour

How much time has passed?
It will continue
disconnecting and then reconnecting.

How wide the window is open?
Can you see it? 

Wind by window

Some-bodies are listening, too
Not just us

I’m standing in front of a tunnel 
The tunnel has open ends
It passes through making the inside resonate

Drip drop
drip drop

Water drops falling 

knock, knock, knock

As if tapping on the door 

Of time 

Dripping and ringing

Strange, isn’t it?

I’ve lived in Georo for 87 years 
Georo means beside the road 
Yang is my family name
In my youth, I was a coachman 
guiding a carriage down this road 
They say there was once a temple 
with a spring that never ran dry
Both the temple and the spring 
were buried during the new road was built
But the spring’s water still flows
seeping into the tunnel from within.
I heard that story from an old woman. 
She was struck by a car on the new road and died
The road is called Beonyoung-ro, 
A name that means thriving road

There are many memorial stones in Georo
placed to remember
wishing the memory firm, like stone
Nonetheless
the green moss starts to settle on the stone 
growing little by little, eroding it
My face, weathered with age spots
The stone, covered in green moss
My face, a memory

The sounds of words scatter.
Where do they all disappear to?

Some-bodies are listening, too.
Not just us.

Sound needs a space 
to resonate
to be heard.
Here is the space? 
Each listeners brings their own time
Like something from far away
Time seems to flow differently
or perhaps it’s not flowing at all
Maybe the idea of flowing is an illusion
We are listening 
sound, words, and images are tailing each other

Once again, we dip our ears into the streams
It’s never the same streams
